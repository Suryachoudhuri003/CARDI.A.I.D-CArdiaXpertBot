## :ðŸ¤–: CARDI.A.I.D** ==> Classification And Regression for Diagnose With Artificial Intelligence and Data Analysis
Telegram Bot ==>  **CardiaXpert**

## :innocent: Purpose
My project's mission is to develop a user-friendly interface using the popular messaging platform Telegram. This interface will allow users to interact with the system, receiving valuable insights and mind-boggling predictions.
Harnessing the cutting-edge techniques of machine learning, we unleash the power of NLP to comprehend and interpret human language. With this capability, seamless communication between users and the system becomes a reality.
But we don't stop there! Our project leverages the prowess of neural networks, employing deep learning algorithms to analyze and process complex data. Brace yourselves for the accuracy and meaningful outputs that await!
By integrating Telegram as the user interface (UI), we provide a convenient and accessible platform for users to tap into the magic of NLP and neural networks. A simple message on Telegram opens up a world of possibilities. Perform sentiment analysis, explore text classification, dive into language translation, or savor personalized recommendations.

## :star: Features and Working
1. My code springs to life, importing the necessary libraries such as NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, and scikit-learn modules. These form the backbone of our AI creation.
2. Within the depths of our code resides a function of epic proportions, aptly named 'heart_disease_classification.' This function takes a file path as input and unleashes its magic upon the data within.
3. Our code embarks on an exploratory data analysis adventure, visualizing the data through count plots, bar plots, scatter plots, and crosstab plots. A feast for the eyes, indeed!
4. But wait, there's more! Our code delves into preprocessing the data, encoding categorical variables using one-hot encoding, and normalizing the numerical features. We split the dataset into training and testing sets, paving the way for our next step.
5. The heart and soul of our project lie in the world of logistic regression. We define several helper functions, initializing parameters, implementing the sigmoid function, performing forward and backward propagation, update the parameters, and finally, making predictions. Logistic regression is just the beginning.
6. We unleash the power of various classification algorithms, including KNN, SVM, Naive Bayes, Decision Tree, and Random Forest.  Our code creates bar plots, allowing us to compare the accuracies of these mighty algorithms. The visual representation adds a touch of enchantment.
7. Our project goes beyond the confines of code and steps into the realm of Telegram bot handlers.
8. Picture this: users can upload a CSV file and witness the marvel of heart disease classification, accompanied by captivating plots generated on the fly.
